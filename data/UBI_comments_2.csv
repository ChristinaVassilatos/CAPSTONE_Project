Well, I don’t take issue with your original comment, and I’m not fond of the dynamics that allow billionaires to accumulate so much wealth while paying relatively little in taxes (although the whole ""so and so paid no taxes this year"" spiel is not really valid) but i also see no reason to go the other way and resent them for doing exactly what we allow them to do or punish them by taking nearly all their wealth. Fiscal conservatives greatly overstate the case for taxation and welfare being disincentives, but that does take effect at some point. It usually takes a lot to drive someone out of their home country, but near-100% taxation is a pretty sure bet if you want to make all the billionaires leave and take their businesses with them, which is like a worst case scenario for systemic risk.

The problem is if we removed all the benefits to do that... it would hurt those at the bottom as they'd lose more than $500/month in benefits.

Double that to $1000/month and youre at 3.2t/year and the current revenue for the Federal Government is 3.5t in 2020. So if you gave $12k/year, removed all welfare options - Medicaide, Medicare, Social Security, Food Stamps, etc, etc, etc...

It's just a bonkers idea to me. Especially since your argument seems to be, if they did there would be less doctors because there would be less pressure to go into a field that has a higher income. 

Well, most doctors I know went into that field for more than just the money frankly. And further more, Idk if you have really thought out this line of reasoning. What are the implications for folks who don't have the skills to move into more highly paid fields? What is the logical conclusion to arguing that essential work should be unsustainable? 

Finally, you basically are arguing that the world only works because people are coerced into working, and thar growth is the goal of all economies. If you don't see the deeply dehumanizing line of this thinking idk what to say. 


I am reminded of a apocryphal line about Cambodia. The king wanted to try and modernize, and to do so he wanted to raise capital by selling agricultural exports. To increase yields he had new technics and farming inputs imported, and they worked great. Something like a 100% increase in yields per-hectare. But for some reason there was no increase in the surplus for export. Turns out all the farmers took those gains and just did half the work, living much more free lives for it. 

I don't remember this world ever deciding it wanted to endlessly ""grow"" the economy, to always let productively gains go to ownership, or be used for export. More free time, more time to be human sounds pretty nice. And at the end of the day, I think UBI supporters are seeking a way to do the above without trying to win people over and fight for a different way to manage people's economic lives. They are misguided sure, but the impulse and the goal seem correct to me.

You are right that ensuring everyone has a UBI of 30K a year (in basically any country,) would be too expensive.  Fortunately, the type of UBI I would propose, around a 1,000 a month is 2.5 times cheaper and would be paid by taxes and savings for social services.  You don't have to pay for homeless services if the homeless are more likely to be housed, for example.  If it were paid with Andrew Yang's vat tax, then 94% of people would see a benefit from it and the remaining 6% would pay more into it, but if you're spending more than 10k a month in goods in services, you didn't need a UBI in the first place.  


UBI proponents (in general, I'm sure you would find some that would disagree,) agree that work is good.  UBI is intended to be a safety net to allow you to be more adventurous.  Move to new places, get out of crappy jobs, start a business, start a family, etc.  When they've done studies, the only people who work less when getting a UBI are college students and expectant mothers/recent mothers.

InverseEvil,,"An UBI might work if the UBI amount paid to each individual is considered taxable income. Taxable income would then be considered to made up of two parts, earned income and UBI.

The tax brackets would need to be adjusted so at some point, let’s say for example $100k pa taxable income ($75k earned income and $25k UBI) you would pay back enough tax that you are essentially paying back the UBI in taxes plus the current tax bracket rate you pay today, so nothing changes for people earning 75k compared to what their net income is today.

You then set the tax free threshold at $25k so you only pay tax if you have an earned income and a part of that tax on your earned income goes towards paying back some of the UBI you received.

If you have $75k or more earned income you essentially don’t receive an UBI payment, people who have between $1 and $74,999 earned income essentially only receive a portion UBI payment and people receiving no earned income get full UBI payment.

And because everyone automatically receives the payment all the infrastructure and cost associated with unemployment, pension and disability payments is eliminated freeing up billions $$ to help pay for the UBI. No more applying for Austudy or jobseeker because you already receive it and the payment amount is taken care of by the tax system. 

The cost will still be more than our current system though but nowhere near as much as you have stated and the benefits could justify the cost.

People will still be incentivised to work because living on the poverty line isn’t good living. When you work you’ll still be far better off than not working.

Nobody in their right mind thinks that labour is inherently bad. It is literally the only thing that produces value in this world and is required for any of the nice material things that we want and need. For now, anyway. 

Personally I think that the entire point of technological development should be to eliminate the need for *necessary* work in the end. What else should be the goal of society except for the emancipation of man from the shackles of scarcity and mortality and so on and so on? I mean, other people will have different ideas but I haven't thought of a better one yet.

As for UBI, it's at least an interesting talking point. Personally I think that many people don't really need an extra $1,000/month or whatever amount you want to set it at; but for most people, an extra $1000/month is an absolutely insane rise in their quality of life and purchasing power. Our modern society requires more consumption than the year before to continue growing (a downfall of our modern economic system in my view), so obviously more purchasing power that is actually used to purchase things is a net positive for the economy. That's why we in Australia got through the GFC so much better than other countries, if you remember. The government literally just gave everyone $700 and told us to go buy stuff, and it worked, for the most part.

Minimum payments are absolutely wasted when the velocity of the money given is 0 due to people who don't need it receiving it and putting it straight into a savings account. Giving money to disadvantaged people who spend it (even on black markets, it doesn't really matter) is a very powerful steroid for an economy built on consumption. When that money is spent at small local businesses, it gets spent by local business owners (hopefully) at other local stores, or on local services, and spent again by locals for more local goods and services and the cycle with that initial money continuing to produce economic value until eventually it makes its way into savings accounts or exported to untaxed offshore accounts (causing an end to the economic value of that money).

Personally I think some kind of basic income is a net positive for an economy as long as the money is distributed in a way where it actually gets spent and re-spent and re-spent locally. That's why ""buy local"" campaigns are worth listening to! It helps your community grow. Money that isn't spent is money wasted.

Marketing only serves to stoke the fire of consumerism. You don’t really need to market basic goods because if people need them they’ll find them.

Recruitment, saves time for employees and employers, but if we weren’t so busy working 10 hours a day you wouldn’t need to save the time etc

DownvoteMeHarderPapi,,"You say “the system” like it’s some faceless, nameless being, but it’s not. We are the system. And I don’t feel as though you address my statement. I I said that people can do meaningful work and still get paid. Most people work 40 hours per week, and after sleeping 8 hours a day we’re left with 72 hours in a week to do anything else we want to do. We can raise children or get an education or start a business or read books or whatever. But in my opinion, there is no reason for us not to be able to earn a living doing meaningful work AND make time for personal growth and fulfillment outside of work. The main issue that I have with UBI is that it takes from those who have money and gives it to those who don’t have money. It removes the fruits of one persons labor and gives it to another. One earns without reward, while another is rewarded without earning. UBI sounds like a good idea at first, but in practice, it just creates a class of dependent people. Look at welfare programs, they haven’t gotten smaller over the decades, they’ve gotten bigger! Welfare was meant to do the same thing that UBI is supposed to do, which was to give people a financial foundation with which to lift themselves up, and yet more and more people get on welfare every year! And that’s not because of a lack of jobs or opportunity, it’s because it de-incentivizes earning a living. If UBI actually worked, we would see welfare recipients thriving because of the help they receive, but instead they aren’t. We would see these people starting businesses, getting exercise, self-educating and more, and yet we don’t see that happening. And more people are becoming dependent on welfare every year. And where is all of that money coming from? It is coming from people who have earned it, and going to those who have not. The best way to create opportunity and abundance for ALL people is to incentivize the creation of meaningful jobs that people can financially support themselves with, without the need for outside assistance. We should work to lower the cost of living, the cost of healthcare, and the cost of an education instead of simply diverting the costs to those who happen to have more money. It’s unjust to take from people, even if you are giving to somebody else.",1586309686,fmqya43,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome
gibmelson,,"&gt; If you believe that people doing meaningless crap is a waste of human potential, then you should advocate for people to do more meaningful work and learn how to get paid to do it. 

The system doesn't care, it incentivizes economical activity to the expense of everything - meaning, environment, health, etc. It's a stupid system that need to evolve or we'll all ride it off a cliff (we're already doing it, with the health epidemics and climate crisis being glaring symptoms). 

UBI is advocating for people - it's recognizing their inherent worth not predicated on some limited notion of market value that we know doesn't align fully with what actually has value to us. We can compensate with an inefficient, bloated, costly patchwork of solutions - million welfare programs, student loans, paid parental leave, minimum wage, etc. that just puts us into conditional boxes and traps, we conform to and that degrades us in the process as it overrides our own will and knowing of how to best spend the resources. 

We own this shit. We create systems that serve us. We create our societal system like court system - you can call it a dependency, it's just a supporting structure that benefits us. Just like every individual or business doesn't have to have their own fire service, because that would be stupid and wasteful - UBI makes the same kind of optimization, by providing an essential structure that needs to be in place to evolve our society to the next level.",1586308427,fmqw98y,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

And the people who currently live on the lower income levels currently pay a negative effective tax rate, they are already incurring a cost on society. And what about the people that currently make good money? Are they supposed to just keep working as hard as they do and keep having their money sent off to some dude who doesn’t want to work at all? Or to some guy who thinks he has the best business ideas but he keeps failing? If everybody is going to get paid no matter what, what is the incentive to work at all? And once enough people stop working at high income/high difficulty jobs to earn all of the money, what will we do? What happens when the wealth creators and the income earners leave the country? What will we do? The money will run out, it literally always does. Then comes the famine. Then come the riots. High taxes wear people down. Obesity is created by over abundance of resources and lack of rigorous, consistent physical activity. Waste also comes from over abundance. Health epidemics come from lack of preparedness. My health is worn down from working my butt off and having close to 30% of my hard-earned money taken from me and spent on wars and corporate bailouts. My aging mother’s health is worn down by working for nearly 50 years and not having much to show for it because so much of her money has been taxed away from her. If you believe that people doing meaningless crap is a waste of human potential, then you should advocate for people to do more meaningful work and learn how to get paid to do it. Advocate for lower taxes so that people can keep more and more of what they earn so that they can better themselves. Advocate for lower government spending so that we can lower the trillions of dollars of waste that the government makes.

gibmelson,,"Several reasons. Right now if you want to rest, breathe out, not work, slow down, scale down, you're endangering your future survival - you disconnect from your job, from support network, and how many have the luxury to even go down in hours at work? Many times your option is to quit in which case your income drops to 0 and you're pressured to go back into the hamster-wheel. With UBI you can quit and live and fall back on your basic income. 

The stress over your future income also makes you hoard material wealth, as a sort of insurance and comfort. With a UBI you don't need to.

&gt; Or why people would suddenly move somewhere more affordable when people don’t do that now, when their entire rent is based on not losing their job.

If you're e.g. a doctor, you probably have student loans weighing you down (UBI will enable people not to take student loans btw), and you're pressured to take a job in a big institution that pays well. Those institutions are located in the big city, and so probably was your school, so you feel naturally inclined to live there. Now you have high rent, student loans, and dependency on a big institution. 

With a UBI you can move to your small hometown, live there with no income at start. Set up your local practice. Get a few clients and a small stream of income. If your practice fails, no big deal - you got your UBI. 

Without a UBI, it's all a huge risk to live smaller and frugally, if your practice fails you have no income, you live far away with no access to income opportunities. You're stuck in a hole.",1586285069,fmppnh0,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

gibmelson,,"Besides income not necessarily going up overall - the big leverage landlords have over people is that we are tied to location for stability and income opportunities. UBI gives people a stable income that is not tied to where you live. Similarly you can be tied to an abusive spouse, family or community, because you depend on them for income, safety, etc. UBI helps release you from that co-dependency and be more independent. 

It will cause more people to move back to their hometowns and start cultivating new roots there, because they are no longer as tied to the big city for income. That might even help pressure rents down in the cities. 

I can see the market for low-rent apartments growing as people want to live frugally on their basic income. If people have that floor they can land on - it gives them the option to say ""no thanks"" to landlords that try squeeze them.

Finally UBI will help fund activism, local journalism, local political engagement, and all those activities that gives the people power and leverage vs existing power structures.

So the net-effect won't be that everyone has extra money to spend, i.e. price of rents and services overall won't go up. The effect is that part of your income stays no matter what you do - which means you become more stable, dynamic, can move easier, change jobs, careers, change path, start businesses, do work that doesn't pay but you know will have long-term value such as child-rearing, caregiving, activism, entrepreneurship, learning, resting, etc. People being more free, secure and having a sense of unconditional value and dignity in the system, will lead to people making more responsible long-term choices, that will have an equalizing effect on everything, including the economy.",1586278854,fmpdf9o,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

In a UBI system, you should be funding it with a VAT anyways and abandoning income tax most likely, but regardless, it's a system of wealth redistribution, and it's being paid for by the wealthy, or it's preventing them from from exploiting people or whatever it is, it's ultimately helping the bottom 50% or so pretty substantially, and a wash for most upper ranged of working people, so if it's a decently designed model, the rich are paying, who cares if they pay an extra 5% to pay themselves or not?

I do understand things change i just see it as inevitable and that at the point where automation takes over money won't really be all too big of a problem and most likely entertainment and digital will be what the market revolves around; things change and people adapt.

No i don't think i will lose my job anytime soon as i have the skillset to develop the automation you speak of, and i think solving the problem would be to free up the market to allow for more niche businesses to grow (something automation won't really take the place of anytime soon).

UBI assumes money will still be needed in a world where resources are being automatically produced, whereas i think that is basically just fallacious thinking saying that everything will be the same always.

The ones arguing for it also assume that automation won't create a ton of new jobs.People back in the day were afraid that automation would destroy their jobs as potters, and while it indeed did there were even more new specialized jobs required for the new automation of pottery.

Everything doesn't need to stay the same, we don't need everyone to work with the same exact things forever, new roles for humanity will arise, moneyless or not and we need to accept it rather than trying to cause mass-inflation by paying everyone.

Som__Tervo,,"It's worth dropping the word ""rich"" entirely. ""Rich"" is totally subjective. Someone making 17k a year (ylcard replied again saying 17k is the most common salary in Spain) will think that someone making 40k a year is rich. Someone making 40k a year will think that having 80-90k a year, like yourself, is rich. While you probably think one has to make 200k+ to be rich. Etc. 

""Rich is relative"". Nobody ever thinks they are ""rich"", even if they're a millionaire, because the more money you have the more of it you spend. Bigger house, better car, higher quality of life, bigger holidays, etc, etc. Someone who makes 5 million a year will probably own a yacht, and a yacht alone costs some 1 million a year to maintain... so all that delicious money disappears because people accrue more outgoings. 

You have kids, so that's a giant money-sucker. One of the most financially-intensive and resource-intensive things you can do. I'm pretty sure UBI is often proposed to have additional 'tiers' where if you have up to 2 kids you get extra money per month, because it's, like, exponentially more expensive. 

Also note that housing cost varies hugely. I don't know Germany too well but I heard Munich and the region is incredibly pricey, for example, in contrast to other regions?

Tarbal81,,"Fair points, to all above me in the thread so far, but I also want to point out that even temporary and tentatively permanent versions of UBI are going to he a treasure trove of new real world experimental data from which to draw new conclusions and better systems from.

A vaguely (vaguely I say!) similar situation would be something like legalizing marijuana in the United States. The governments of states that fully legalized for recreation learned fairly quickly that they needed to price competitively with dealers from pre-legalization, because they did not generate the type of revenue they anticipated, since if the weed was too expensive,  people would just go to their old dealer for better prices. The tax rates were adjusted from what I understand to encourage people to buy from legal dispensaries. I feel something similar will happen with UBI. We have an idea of how it will function sustainably,  and these full country experiments will be a great model to build from. 

Another vaguely similar extreme paradigm change would be full decriminalization of all drugs for personal use in Portugal, with different consequences for infractions built around rehabilitation rather than punishment. It showed how addiction rates are fixed and have nothing to do with legalization, and thus punishment is not a deterrent. This info has gone a long way to pushing larger paradigm shifts toward new programs geared towards harm reduction and legalization. 

I think the takeaway here should be that as time goes on and we have large scale social and economic experiments like the ones I mentioned above, and that were mentioned by others above, will all serve to really give our governments, societies, and cultures the information they need to craft a utopia.

I can pull up references for everything I stated as fact above, but I am on my phone avoiding thinking about the burial I am currently on my way to (social distancing precautions being maintained, of course).",1586187048,fmliflt,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

Som__Tervo,pos,"See u/ylcard's response which says the opposite. ylcard is a Spaniard and says 40k is incredibly high.

What did you think of the rest of my post?

Re average income, I did some very superficial digging. Seriously, you'd be surprised how ""low"" the barrier for wage is to put you in the top percentiles of wage earners. 

\- average income across the EU ranges from 12,000 Euro per year to 50,000 Euro per year. The majority of countries land around 32,000 Euro per year as an average. Even though it doesn't look like much, there is a BIG jump from 30,000 to 40,000 per year. A jump which takes you from ""normal person"", i.e. most of the population, to the ""wealthy minority"" of the population, the top 10%. 

\- western Europe is mostly around 32,000 (UK, Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, etc), with a few spikes to 50,000 (e.g. your tax haven states like Luxembourg and Switzerland, where a disproportionately large number of the super-rich will pull the median up)

\- In the UK, making over £40,000 per year (45,000 Euro) puts you in the top 10% of the population, income-wise. This was found several times in recent years and published by several papers. The ""average"" income of people working in the UK is around £25,000 (28,000 Euro) per year. **I imagine this is true of most western European countries.** Your ""average joe"" probably makes between 20-30k per year.

\- central and eastern europe is far lower, like 20,000 Euro per year average. Make over 30kpy there and you're definitely in the top 10%.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding UBI, EVERYONE gets the money. It ignores tax and deductibles; it's literally universal. It doesn't matter if you're a millionaire or homeless. The idea here is one of ""relative value"":  
**- to a person who makes 200k+ per year, the UBI is essentially nothing**. Pocket change. They'd never apply for benefits/funding anyway so it does nothing but save admin time for the government (not having to ""separate"" these people out)

**- to a person who makes 30k per year or less, UBI will provide a bit of a safety net.** It'll buffer the bank account a little, make sure everything is OK in case of catastrophe (e.g. a global pandemic ruining the economy...) and provide some peace of mind. 

**- to a person who makes 20k per year or less, UBI will provide a MASSIVE quality of life change.** It'll allow them to focus more on self-improvement and education over losing all their time to stressful menial jobs which barely provide quality of life. It will also alleviate mental health challenges as people don't need to worry about survival based on the next paycheck

**- to a person who is unemployed or homeless, UBI will be LIFE CHANGING,** for the reasons above, but on an even more substantial level.

This all broadly relates to the ""diminishing returns"" of wealth. That is, where each jump in 10k earnings per year provides extreme improvements to quality of life initially, but declines and declines with each 10k, until by 50k+ you'll notice little to no quality of life change as you earn more. You don't get happier after you earn 50k (in Euros or Pounds - NOT in US Dollars.) 

UBI saves the government from spending lots on working out WHO should get a benefit, and instead gives it to EVERYONE. Which has massive ramifications for the poorest in society (the homeless, unemployed, and those earning under say 15k per year).",1586173525,fmkyp9l,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

Ken_Century,pos,"I think you are spot on with your debate over the means test. It seems odd to give wealthy people the same amount of money as poor people, but in the end a progressive tax system would keep the overall welfare system progressive.  

Making the program universal has two main benefits as I see it. First, a flat benefit is inherently progressive because that $2000 or whatever amount is more meaningful to lower income beneficiaries than higher income beneficiaries (much like how a flat tax is inherently regressive). Second, a universal benefit helps reduce disincentives to work among other economic distortions such as income shielding. I think it also would also help create support for the system, as it adds a sense of fairness to it where the wealthy see that they receive the benefit and understand better what it is. This could help it achieve broader support.

While a means test seems like a good idea at first glance, it doesn’t save as much money as you may think because it’d only exclude a small percentage of the population, introduces obstacles such as disincentives to work and ideological opposition to the policy, and can easily be compensated for with a fair, progressive tax scheme.",1586166729,fmksbwj,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

Not only can almost all manual labour be replaced but also almost all mental labour like data entry and clerical work. The new jobs that would be created are said to be programmers and the like but machines already program themselves and other machines. Even if these jobs did become more widespread we'd need a more educated workforce which the US doesn't promote since its unis are so expensive and unemployment rules meaning you have to search for any old shitty job rather than getting an education.

Once all those jobs start to disappear, even the ones that people say could be more widespread, the resulting mass unemployment will mean that UBI will be the only way in my view to save capitalism. If like 30% of the population has no disposable income there wont be amy money to purchase from businesses and the economy will fail, we are literally seeing this right now in the US which is why trump is doing his $1000.

In the UK, £40,000 per year puts you in the top 10% of the population in terms of income (I think nowadays that sum is comparable to $90,000pa?). ""Rich"" is obviously a vague term, but if you make 40 grand a year in the UK you are incredibly comfortable. 40,000 Euros is a bit less, I think.

""Does UBI philosophy also call for high taxes?""

On paper, UBI is supposed to SAVE money by retiring all the the man-hour and systems-heavy instruments which are used to determine whether people *really need* benefits or not. Made-up example: if you have to multiple government workers £24,000 a year (like $50kpy) to go through all benefits applications and ""sign off"" on whether applicants *deserve* the benefit claim, AND you need government ministers to ""sign off"" on the overall benefit plans, AND you need distribution and gathering systems to allow people to apply to the benefit/welfare scheme, AND you need servers and websites and systems infrastructure to maintain it, with banking/vault systems... You're already probably millions out of pocket each year *just maintaining the existing benefit/welfare system*.

So with UBI, the solution is that you scrap all of that. Every worker making calculations, every worker reading/checking applications, all information and application distribution, all systems... you SAVE tons of money. And in return, you provide every registered human in the country with a monthly lump sum - which typically ends up being MORE than what they would have received in benefits (not always, especially when kids are involved).

But I have not spent much time reading and thinking on this so am open to the counter arguments, no matter how fundamental, it might just be that I am not seeing something obvious. My only thought right here as I drink my coffee is that it might disincentive anyone reaching that limit—would you rather make 245k and keep getting that 2k per month? Probably. So would it lead to new forms of corruption and hiding money? 

Does UBI philosophy also call for high taxes? Or is that not part of it? I live in a pretty high income tax country and actually find that is exactly how it should be. Obviously there is corruption and waste in government but my we don’t spend a trillion per year on bullshit wars, and I know my taxes are going to healthcare , free college for my kids, good roads and shit.

Wheream_I,,"&gt; In essence, the stimulus check acts as an advance of your 2020 income tax refund. This means when you prepare your 2020 income tax return, there will be a line to include the section 6428 credit. The credit on your 2020 return is subtracted by any amount received as a stimulus check in 2020

It’s a forward on your 2020 tax return. It’s the same way it worked in 2008.

With all these paychecks, may as well run an aptitude test and start milling out some license plates. It’ll supplement the prison labor economy in the US.

turqua,,"A minimum vital income (MVI) is fundamentally different from a universal basic income (UBI). UBI is granted to everyone regardless of existing income - for example: everyone in society gets 2,000 per month including Bill Gates. MVI sounds like people could get income, but for example if you earn above 40,000 per annum you are not eligible. The latter goes against the fundamental ideas of UBI.",1586146305,fmk76px,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome
lord_zetsuei,,"While it doesn't exactly sku the numbers very heavily, wouldn't we assume that the population receiving the income would be the 18+ demographic? That would take the total down to 210 million roughly 63% or so. Now, I can't find the current statistics for citizenship in the US, the 2014 numbers put the number of non-citizens at around 7 percent. Assuming this number holds equally for demographics over and under 18, the population that would be receiving the UBI would be around 195 million.  


Overall, that brings the cost down to around 2.34 trillion per year assuming 1000 per month.  


Thing is though, I think that the US has other issues to address before UBI becomes feasible regardless, such as cost of living in certain areas. Leaving out areas like Manhattan and San Francisco metro areas, with some of the highest CoL in the US, there are suburban areas with rent well over 2k/mo for basic 2br homes or apartments. This sort of nonsense is a major obstacle to UBI anyway, and would make implementation in the US pointless.",1586145343,fmk5w33,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

Novarest,,"The Minister of Economy has assured in laSexta that the Government is already working on the implementation of the minimum vital income for the Spanish population. "" It is in the government agreement and we are going to implement it in the course of the legislature, "" said Nadia Calviño, who stressed that ""there are elements that must be taken into account.""

""Minister Escrivá, along with other ministries, is coordinating how to prepare that minimum vital income , how it is complemented by other instruments and what is the target population,"" Calviño explained, adding that they will focus ""a lot on the families, but differentiating the circumstances. ""

The minister has indicated that the objective is to launch ""a start, a pilot, of what you want to implement in a general and permanent way."" However, Calviño has not given a specific date on the activation of this vital minimum income.

""The work is complicated and we are on many fronts at the moment, but the ministry is working decisively on it and we will do it as soon as possible,"" the Minister of Economy continued, explaining that, in the face of the health crisis caused by the coronavirus from the Government is "" taking a series of measures so that no one is left out or left behind , starting with the workers.""

Calviño has insisted that the Government has ""greatly strengthened the capacity in the field of social policies so that, until the minimum vital income is put into operation, there are a multitude of instruments that support the population,"" with special emphasis on ""The most vulnerable"".

But is it possible that it can be started between now and summer? This is the question that the journalist Ana Pastor has asked the minister, who again did not want to enter to give a specific date on the possible application of this measure: “We are going to do it as soon as possible. So that it is useful, but not only for this exceptional situation, and that it stays forever ”.",1586141604,fmk0gcj,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome
