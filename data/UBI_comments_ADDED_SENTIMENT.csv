Well, I don’t take issue with your original comment, and I’m not fond of the dynamics that allow billionaires to accumulate so much wealth while paying relatively little in taxes (although the whole ""so and so paid no taxes this year"" spiel is not really valid) but i also see no reason to go the other way and resent them for doing exactly what we allow them to do or punish them by taking nearly all their wealth. Fiscal conservatives greatly overstate the case for taxation and welfare being disincentives, but that does take effect at some point. It usually takes a lot to drive someone out of their home country, but near-100% taxation is a pretty sure bet if you want to make all the billionaires leave and take their businesses with them, which is like a worst case scenario for systemic risk.

The problem is if we removed all the benefits to do that... it would hurt those at the bottom as they'd lose more than $500/month in benefits.

Double that to $1000/month and youre at 3.2t/year and the current revenue for the Federal Government is 3.5t in 2020. So if you gave $12k/year, removed all welfare options - Medicaide, Medicare, Social Security, Food Stamps, etc, etc, etc... 

If you ration the ""UBI""? only give it to ""poor""? The you're right back into beuracracy and welfare state that gives to some... and if you limited it to half the population? you'd be at $2k/month which would still be less than a large % of the poorest receive when all the benefits are added up.

It has very little in common with a situation where we pay for increased social programs year-over-year with taxes, in which case the only inflation it might cause is demand-pull as a result of people having more in their pockets and actually spending it, since most of the people who would be receiving UBI/NIT payments have a higher marginal propensity to spend than the people who would be paying the majority of it.

It's just a bonkers idea to me. Especially since your argument seems to be, if they did there would be less doctors because there would be less pressure to go into a field that has a higher income. 

Well, most doctors I know went into that field for more than just the money frankly. And further more, Idk if you have really thought out this line of reasoning. What are the implications for folks who don't have the skills to move into more highly paid fields? What is the logical conclusion to arguing that essential work should be unsustainable? 

Finally, you basically are arguing that the world only works because people are coerced into working, and thar growth is the goal of all economies. If you don't see the deeply dehumanizing line of this thinking idk what to say. 


I am reminded of a apocryphal line about Cambodia. The king wanted to try and modernize, and to do so he wanted to raise capital by selling agricultural exports. To increase yields he had new technics and farming inputs imported, and they worked great. Something like a 100% increase in yields per-hectare. But for some reason there was no increase in the surplus for export. Turns out all the farmers took those gains and just did half the work, living much more free lives for it. 

I don't remember this world ever deciding it wanted to endlessly ""grow"" the economy, to always let productively gains go to ownership, or be used for export. More free time, more time to be human sounds pretty nice. And at the end of the day, I think UBI supporters are seeking a way to do the above without trying to win people over and fight for a different way to manage people's economic lives. They are misguided sure, but the impulse and the goal seem correct to me.

You are right that ensuring everyone has a UBI of 30K a year (in basically any country,) would be too expensive.  Fortunately, the type of UBI I would propose, around a 1,000 a month is 2.5 times cheaper and would be paid by taxes and savings for social services.  You don't have to pay for homeless services if the homeless are more likely to be housed, for example.  If it were paid with Andrew Yang's vat tax, then 94% of people would see a benefit from it and the remaining 6% would pay more into it, but if you're spending more than 10k a month in goods in services, you didn't need a UBI in the first place.  


UBI proponents (in general, I'm sure you would find some that would disagree,) agree that work is good.  UBI is intended to be a safety net to allow you to be more adventurous.  Move to new places, get out of crappy jobs, start a business, start a family, etc.  When they've done studies, the only people who work less when getting a UBI are college students and expectant mothers/recent mothers.  I know that if I got a UBI, I wouldn't stop working.  I'd pay off my house faster and invest in the stock market more, as well as fix up my house a bit.  2 out of 3 of those expand the economy, and if it's not done by printing money (which I agree, we shouldn't print money to do it,) then it shouldn't have that much of an inflationary effect.",1639245630,ho59osl,t3_rdrvin,Capitalism

InverseEvil,pos,"An UBI might work if the UBI amount paid to each individual is considered taxable income. Taxable income would then be considered to made up of two parts, earned income and UBI.

The tax brackets would need to be adjusted so at some point, let’s say for example $100k pa taxable income ($75k earned income and $25k UBI) you would pay back enough tax that you are essentially paying back the UBI in taxes plus the current tax bracket rate you pay today, so nothing changes for people earning 75k compared to what their net income is today.

You then set the tax free threshold at $25k so you only pay tax if you have an earned income and a part of that tax on your earned income goes towards paying back some of the UBI you received.

If you have $75k or more earned income you essentially don’t receive an UBI payment, people who have between $1 and $74,999 earned income essentially only receive a portion UBI payment and people receiving no earned income get full UBI payment.

And because everyone automatically receives the payment all the infrastructure and cost associated with unemployment, pension and disability payments is eliminated freeing up billions $$ to help pay for the UBI. No more applying for Austudy or jobseeker because you already receive it and the payment amount is taken care of by the tax system. 

The cost will still be more than our current system though but nowhere near as much as you have stated and the benefits could justify the cost.

People will still be incentivised to work because living on the poverty line isn’t good living. When you work you’ll still be far better off than not working.

Nobody in their right mind thinks that labour is inherently bad. It is literally the only thing that produces value in this world and is required for any of the nice material things that we want and need. For now, anyway. 

Personally I think that the entire point of technological development should be to eliminate the need for *necessary* work in the end. What else should be the goal of society except for the emancipation of man from the shackles of scarcity and mortality and so on and so on? I mean, other people will have different ideas but I haven't thought of a better one yet.

As for UBI, it's at least an interesting talking point. Personally I think that many people don't really need an extra $1,000/month or whatever amount you want to set it at; but for most people, an extra $1000/month is an absolutely insane rise in their quality of life and purchasing power. Our modern society requires more consumption than the year before to continue growing (a downfall of our modern economic system in my view), so obviously more purchasing power that is actually used to purchase things is a net positive for the economy. That's why we in Australia got through the GFC so much better than other countries, if you remember. The government literally just gave everyone $700 and told us to go buy stuff, and it worked, for the most part.

Minimum payments are absolutely wasted when the velocity of the money given is 0 due to people who don't need it receiving it and putting it straight into a savings account. Giving money to disadvantaged people who spend it (even on black markets, it doesn't really matter) is a very powerful steroid for an economy built on consumption. When that money is spent at small local businesses, it gets spent by local business owners (hopefully) at other local stores, or on local services, and spent again by locals for more local goods and services and the cycle with that initial money continuing to produce economic value until eventually it makes its way into savings accounts or exported to untaxed offshore accounts (causing an end to the economic value of that money).

Personally I think some kind of basic income is a net positive for an economy as long as the money is distributed in a way where it actually gets spent and re-spent and re-spent locally. That's why ""buy local"" campaigns are worth listening to! It helps your community grow. Money that isn't spent is money wasted.

Marketing only serves to stoke the fire of consumerism. You don’t really need to market basic goods because if people need them they’ll find them.

Recruitment, saves time for employees and employers, but if we weren’t so busy working 10 hours a day you wouldn’t need to save the time etc

DownvoteMeHarderPapi,neg,"You say “the system” like it’s some faceless, nameless being, but it’s not. We are the system. And I don’t feel as though you address my statement. I I said that people can do meaningful work and still get paid. Most people work 40 hours per week, and after sleeping 8 hours a day we’re left with 72 hours in a week to do anything else we want to do. We can raise children or get an education or start a business or read books or whatever. But in my opinion, there is no reason for us not to be able to earn a living doing meaningful work AND make time for personal growth and fulfillment outside of work. The main issue that I have with UBI is that it takes from those who have money and gives it to those who don’t have money. It removes the fruits of one persons labor and gives it to another. One earns without reward, while another is rewarded without earning. UBI sounds like a good idea at first, but in practice, it just creates a class of dependent people. Look at welfare programs, they haven’t gotten smaller over the decades, they’ve gotten bigger! Welfare was meant to do the same thing that UBI is supposed to do, which was to give people a financial foundation with which to lift themselves up, and yet more and more people get on welfare every year! And that’s not because of a lack of jobs or opportunity, it’s because it de-incentivizes earning a living. If UBI actually worked, we would see welfare recipients thriving because of the help they receive, but instead they aren’t. We would see these people starting businesses, getting exercise, self-educating and more, and yet we don’t see that happening. And more people are becoming dependent on welfare every year. And where is all of that money coming from? It is coming from people who have earned it, and going to those who have not. The best way to create opportunity and abundance for ALL people is to incentivize the creation of meaningful jobs that people can financially support themselves with, without the need for outside assistance. We should work to lower the cost of living, the cost of healthcare, and the cost of an education instead of simply diverting the costs to those who happen to have more money. It’s unjust to take from people, even if you are giving to somebody else.",1586309686,fmqya43,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

The system doesn't care, it incentivizes economical activity to the expense of everything - meaning, environment, health, etc. It's a stupid system that need to evolve or we'll all ride it off a cliff (we're already doing it, with the health epidemics and climate crisis being glaring symptoms). 

UBI is advocating for people - it's recognizing their inherent worth not predicated on some limited notion of market value that we know doesn't align fully with what actually has value to us. We can compensate with an inefficient, bloated, costly patchwork of solutions - million welfare programs, student loans, paid parental leave, minimum wage, etc. that just puts us into conditional boxes and traps, we conform to and that degrades us in the process as it overrides our own will and knowing of how to best spend the resources. 

We own this shit. We create systems that serve us. We create our societal system like court system - you can call it a dependency, it's just a supporting structure that benefits us. Just like every individual or business doesn't have to have their own fire service, because that would be stupid and wasteful - UBI makes the same kind of optimization, by providing an essential structure that needs to be in place to evolve our society to the next level.",1586308427,fmqw98y,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

Or to some guy who thinks he has the best business ideas but he keeps failing? If everybody is going to get paid no matter what, what is the incentive to work at all? And once enough people stop working at high income/high difficulty jobs to earn all of the money, what will we do? What happens when the wealth creators and the income earners leave the country? What will we do? The money will run out, it literally always does. Then comes the famine. Then come the riots. High taxes wear people down. Obesity is created by over abundance of resources and lack of rigorous, consistent physical activity. Waste also comes from over abundance. Health epidemics come from lack of preparedness. My health is worn down from working my butt off and having close to 30% of my hard-earned money taken from me and spent on wars and corporate bailouts. My aging mother’s health is worn down by working for nearly 50 years and not having much to show for it because so much of her money has been taxed away from her.

Som__Tervo,pos,"See u/ylcard's response which says the opposite. ylcard is a Spaniard and says 40k is incredibly high.

What did you think of the rest of my post?

Re average income, I did some very superficial digging. Seriously, you'd be surprised how ""low"" the barrier for wage is to put you in the top percentiles of wage earners. 

\- average income across the EU ranges from 12,000 Euro per year to 50,000 Euro per year. The majority of countries land around 32,000 Euro per year as an average. Even though it doesn't look like much, there is a BIG jump from 30,000 to 40,000 per year. A jump which takes you from ""normal person"", i.e. most of the population, to the ""wealthy minority"" of the population, the top 10%. 

\- western Europe is mostly around 32,000 (UK, Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, etc), with a few spikes to 50,000 (e.g. your tax haven states like Luxembourg and Switzerland, where a disproportionately large number of the super-rich will pull the median up)

\- In the UK, making over £40,000 per year (45,000 Euro) puts you in the top 10% of the population, income-wise. This was found several times in recent years and published by several papers. The ""average"" income of people working in the UK is around £25,000 (28,000 Euro) per year. **I imagine this is true of most western European countries.** Your ""average joe"" probably makes between 20-30k per year.

\- central and eastern europe is far lower, like 20,000 Euro per year average. Make over 30kpy there and you're definitely in the top 10%.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding UBI, EVERYONE gets the money. It ignores tax and deductibles; it's literally universal. It doesn't matter if you're a millionaire or homeless. The idea here is one of ""relative value"":  
**- to a person who makes 200k+ per year, the UBI is essentially nothing**. Pocket change. They'd never apply for benefits/funding anyway so it does nothing but save admin time for the government (not having to ""separate"" these people out)

**- to a person who makes 30k per year or less, UBI will provide a bit of a safety net.** It'll buffer the bank account a little, make sure everything is OK in case of catastrophe (e.g. a global pandemic ruining the economy...) and provide some peace of mind. 

**- to a person who makes 20k per year or less, UBI will provide a MASSIVE quality of life change.** It'll allow them to focus more on self-improvement and education over losing all their time to stressful menial jobs which barely provide quality of life. It will also alleviate mental health challenges as people don't need to worry about survival based on the next paycheck

**- to a person who is unemployed or homeless, UBI will be LIFE CHANGING,** for the reasons above, but on an even more substantial level.

This all broadly relates to the ""diminishing returns"" of wealth. That is, where each jump in 10k earnings per year provides extreme improvements to quality of life initially, but declines and declines with each 10k, until by 50k+ you'll notice little to no quality of life change as you earn more. You don't get happier after you earn 50k (in Euros or Pounds - NOT in US Dollars.) 

UBI saves the government from spending lots on working out WHO should get a benefit, and instead gives it to EVERYONE. Which has massive ramifications for the poorest in society (the homeless, unemployed, and those earning under say 15k per year).",1586173525,fmkyp9l,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

As expected the politics of the poverty apologists and austerity fanatics has failed and lead to bankruptcy. Like 100 years ago.

&gt;There is  absolutely no way economically they can make this work without serious  adjustments to their structural set up

Yes. The basic income is part of the serious adjustment away from poverty and austerity that limits the country for no good reason.

There are 3 main reasons to propose a basic income:

* No tolerance of poverty.
* No deflation and depression because buyers are too poor. Money flows naturally from buyer to seller. Money does not flow naturally from investor (banks) to producer to buyer.

Ken_Century,pos,"I think you are spot on with your debate over the means test. It seems odd to give wealthy people the same amount of money as poor people, but in the end a progressive tax system would keep the overall welfare system progressive.  

Making the program universal has two main benefits as I see it. First, a flat benefit is inherently progressive because that $2000 or whatever amount is more meaningful to lower income beneficiaries than higher income beneficiaries (much like how a flat tax is inherently regressive). Second, a universal benefit helps reduce disincentives to work among other economic distortions such as income shielding. I think it also would also help create support for the system, as it adds a sense of fairness to it where the wealthy see that they receive the benefit and understand better what it is. This could help it achieve broader support.

While a means test seems like a good idea at first glance, it doesn’t save as much money as you may think because it’d only exclude a small percentage of the population, introduces obstacles such as disincentives to work and ideological opposition to the policy, and can easily be compensated for with a fair, progressive tax scheme.",1586166729,fmksbwj,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

PoliticsRealityTV,pos,"I’m republican and I absolutely love UBI. Andrew Yang is the only democrat I know that supports UBI and I was willing to sacrifice all of my other values to get this guy into office, so I donated to him. UBI is not a democratic policy, nor a republican one. It is inherently libertarian.",1586165103,fmkqwf3,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

pkej,pos,"My take would be move all those checking the citizens compliance to checking corporate compliance and boost tax income from the corporate and finance sectors. 

More white collar crime investigation and prosecution. More investigation of any crimes against nature and society. 

And pay one lump sum, as UBI, to everyone. Noone can say it is unfair then, and no administration is needed, as you pointed out, nobody loose their government jobs, and we'll stick it to the corporations as well.",1586164765,fmkqlqk,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome

Pyrdwein,pos,"That's not ubi, that's communism. Which is a theory that failed in application. UBI likely will too due similar obstruction and power grabs, but it's worth trying. Wealth inequality is the most destructive force on human society in the modern age.",1586164547,fmkqexr,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome
lafigatatia,neu,"I'm from Spain. As much as I'd like the news to be true, his is NOT UBI and not even close to UBI. It's a guaranteed minimum income: if you work you don't get it. You only receive it if you're unemployed or unable to work and you don't already receive social security payments (unemployment insurance, disability...). It would benefit many people during the crisis, but only a very small amount afterwards. And they have only confifrmed it will be implemented, but not when.",1586164533,fmkqegr,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome
rv009,pos,"Did u even read the article? Not once did they mention that it didnt work just that they pretty much just cancelled it. All the trails that have been run for UBI are cancelled too early.  But some of them do find that it helps people to go back to school to increase skills or they start their own businesses.

The reason republicans dont want this program is that they would have to pay more than what they pay now for employees. Why would I work for you for less than 15$ an hour if I can start my own business or go back to school where I can get a job that can potentially pay me 50-100$ per hour.

You Republicans just refuse to let go of the slave labour. Get over it.",1586164533,fmkqegl,t3_fvolc0,BasicIncome
